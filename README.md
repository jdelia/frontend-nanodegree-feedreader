## Instructions

### How this works

The web page loads four different unique RSS feeds and displays each one when you click on the corresponding menu item which is generated when the page loads.

### Testing

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is loaded and randomly runs individual tests against the Javascript code for validation. This method ensures that when you make a change to the code, it does not break any of the functionality you've built. It saves time by running these test automatically instead of you having to test each one again after making code changes.

You will see the tests and results displayed at the bottom of the screen.

### Code Editor

This was built with VS Code and the package.json files loads linting and formatting files. It is not required to run this web page.
